    ## 1. **TypeScript & Type Safety**
- Some components have incomplete type annotations (e.g., `IState` interfaces with `false` literal types instead of `boolean`)
- Add proper typing for event handlers and refs
- Consider using more specific types instead of `any` or generic objects

## 2. **State Management & Reactivity**
- Replace `reactive()` with `ref()` for primitive values for better performance
- Use `computed()` for derived state instead of recalculating in templates
- Consider using `readonly()` for immutable data

## 3. **Error Handling & UX**
- Replace generic `'Invalid Form!'` messages with specific validation feedback
- Add loading states for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use toast notifications instead of `confirm()` and `alert()`

## 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- Add `v-memo` for expensive list renderings
- Use `shallowRef()` for large objects that don't need deep reactivity
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling for data tables

## 6. **Security & Data Handling**
- Sanitize user inputs, especially in currency calculations
- Add input validation on both client and server side
- Consider implementing data encryption for sensitive financial information

## 7. **Accessibility & Internationalization**
- Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- The i18n setup looks good, but ensure all user-facing strings are translated

## 9. **Component Structure**
- Extract reusable logic into composables
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Create a proper component library structure

## 10. **Testing & Documentation**
- Add unit tests for critical financial calculations
- Document complex business logic
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or help implement specific improvements?
